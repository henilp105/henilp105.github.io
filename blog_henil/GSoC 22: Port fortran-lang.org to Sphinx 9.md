Greetings of the Day Everyone!

This week as we have decided to shift the sphinx site to a new repo (https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage), I have ported the sphinx site to my fork of new repo and also added various functionalities like:

1. Workflow based Build Preview for PRs with build status notifications.
2. Workflow based Delete Preview for PRs with status notifications.
3. Shifted the site to new gh pages of my fork.
4. Added design changes in accordance to feedback from community members.
5. Made the Sphinx site repo neat , and also removed unnecessary files.
6. Added Documentation of site ( Contributing, Minibooks,Packages) (README will be added later to avoid deletions in PR.)
7. Added some design changes in the learn section.
8. Added daily build of the site using a cron based workflow.
   I will be maintaining my fork’s github pages here : https://henilp105.github.io/webpage/en/.

The link of the Github pages has been changed to avoid build conflicts and to preserve the existing site at a subdomain.All the changes can be found at my fork's github pages.

All the pages of the website are being rendered by Sphinx only.

Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: henilp105@gmail.com.I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links here.

Thanks and Regards,

Henil Shalin Panchal
