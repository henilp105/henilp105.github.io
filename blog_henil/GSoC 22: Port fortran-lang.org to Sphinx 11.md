Greetings of the Day Everyone!
This week as we have decided to shift the sphinx site to a new repo (https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage), I have ported the sphinx site to my fork of new repo and also added various functionalities like:

- [x] resolves the setup python bug #4 ( there was a bug in v4 which prevented the detection of python version , setting that version of python manually resolves the bug.)
- [x] resolves the ablog #36 dependabot pr.
- [x] github pages url for pr preview.
- [x] resolves the learn section button translation bug
- [x] updated the translations for learn section button.
- [x] shift from custom navbar to original navbar
- [x] added pr preview banner for preview builds. (independent of the pydata theme version).
- [x] added documentation for pre-commit hooks.
- [x] locked the dependency versions of packages.
- [x] Formated the html templates.
- [x] resolved the date error in newsletter of june 2022.
- [x] enabled build of all translations for build preview
- [x] resolved #29 (for index page)
- [x] added dependabot for requirements.txt
- [x] updated translations

  I will be maintaining my fortran-lang's github pages here : https://fortran-lang.github.io/webpage/en/index.html
  All the pages of the website are being rendered by Sphinx only.
  Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: [henilp105@gmail.com](mailto:henilp105@gmail.com).
  I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Et-2JPlnA9SAssSnmzkYeXQ1ExXqBI5tcdBQhuqvilE/edit?usp=sharing).
