Greetings of the Day Everyone!

This week I have Implemented packages Section Tags of all the libraries by making a python script to fetch the latest repo data and also implemented graphs in the community section which fetch the latest data every day by using a cron based github workflow. All the changes can be found at my fork's github pages.

I will be maintaining my fork’s github pages here : https://henilp105.github.io/fortran-lang.org/ .

All the pages of the website are being rendered by Sphinx only.

Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: henilp105@gmail.com.

I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links here.

Thanks and Regards,
Henil Shalin Panchal
