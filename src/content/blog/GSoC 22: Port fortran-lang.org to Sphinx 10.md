Greetings of the Day Everyone!
This week as we have decided to shift the sphinx site to a new repo (https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage), I have ported the sphinx site to my fork of new repo and also added various functionalities like:

1. Added pylint and black
2. Merged the PR#1 for the webpage repo.
3. Shifted the site to new gh pages of fortran-lang.
4. Added design changes in accordance to feedback from community members.
5. Made the Sphinx site repo neat , and also removed unnecessary files added build artifacts.
6. Added Documentation of site to directory ( Contributing, Minibooks,Packages)
   I will be maintaining my fortran-lang's github pages here : https://fortran-lang.github.io/webpage/en/index.html
   The link of the Github pages has been changed to avoid build conflicts and to preserve the existing site at a subdomain.All the changes can be found at my fork's github pages.
   All the pages of the website are being rendered by Sphinx only.
   Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: [henilp105@gmail.com](mailto:henilp105@gmail.com).
   I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Et-2JPlnA9SAssSnmzkYeXQ1ExXqBI5tcdBQhuqvilE/edit?usp=sharing).
   Thanks and Regards,
   Henil Shalin Panchal
