Greetings of the Day Everyone!
This week I have Implemented design changes in various pages with the sphinx design. various functionalities like:
Decrease the build time of the entire site to ~2.5mins ( which is ~26 sec per language build, reduction of over build time of 5 mins).
Added Github activity stats on the community page.
Added custom in page toc for various sections of the learn section.
Formatted the existing code for better readability.
Updated the locale files for translation.

I will be maintaining my fork’s github pages here : https://henilp105.github.io/fortran-lang.org/en/ .

The link of the Github pages has been changed to help in translations.All the changes can be found at my fork's github pages.
All the pages of the website are being rendered by Sphinx only.
Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: henilp105@gmail.com.
I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links here.

Thanks and Regards,
Henil Shalin Panchal
