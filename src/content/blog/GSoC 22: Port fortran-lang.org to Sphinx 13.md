Greetings of the Day Everyone!
We plan to finish the migration by the end of this week.Once we have migrated to the sphinx based webpage this repository will be available at the default GH pages URL https://fortran-lang.github.io/fortran-lang.org and we will create a banner on the new webpage referencing the old repository in case somebody finds something missing.
This week as we have decided to shift the sphinx site to a new repo (https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage), I have ported the sphinx site to my fork of new repo and also added various functionalities like:

- [x] resolves #120
- [x] resolves #122
- [x] documentation for learn section.
- [x] resolves workflow delete preview bug
- [x] update translation po files.
      I will be maintaining my fortran-lang's github pages here : https://fortran-lang.github.io/webpage/en/index.html
      The link of the Github pages has been changed to avoid build conflicts and to preserve the existing site at a subdomain.All the changes can be found at my fork's github pages.

All the pages of the website are being rendered by Sphinx only.
Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: [henilp105@gmail.com](mailto:henilp105@gmail.com).
I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Et-2JPlnA9SAssSnmzkYeXQ1ExXqBI5tcdBQhuqvilE/edit?usp=sharing).
Thanks and Regards,
Henil Shalin Panchal
