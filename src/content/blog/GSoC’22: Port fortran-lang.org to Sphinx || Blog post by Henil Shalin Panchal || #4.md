Greetings of the Day Everyone!
This week I have Implemented learn page with all the functionalities using the sphinx extension for jinja templating. I have also updated the compilers page with new design.This week I have also completed the learn and the Compilers section. All the changes can be found at my fork's github pages.
I will be maintaining my fork’s github pages here : https://henilp105.github.io/fortran-lang.org/ .
Some of the pages are currently being rendered by sphinx and all other pages are being rendered by jekyll.
Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: henilp105@gmail.com.
I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links here.
Thanks and Regards,
