Greetings of the Day Everyone!
This post marks the start of my GSoC Project’s Coding period.
I will be maintaining my fork’s github pages here : https://henilp105.github.io/fortran-lang.org/ .
Some of the pages are currently being rendered by sphinx and all other pages are being rendered by jekyll.
The tasks that I have in my mind for this week are:
Common repository for both Jekyll and Sphinx webpages in my fork.
Implement Custom Index page in sphinx.
Implement the Learn and compilers section in sphinx.
Setup github actions for build of jekyll and sphinx pages.
Discuss with my mentors and other org members regarding implementation of my project plan.
Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: henilp105@gmail.com.
I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links here.
Thanks and Regards,
Henil Shalin Panchal
