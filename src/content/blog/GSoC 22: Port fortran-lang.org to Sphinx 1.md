Greetings of the Day Everyone!
I am Henil Shalin Panchal . I will be working on the GSoC project on Porting fortran-lang.org to Sphinx.
This post marks the start of my GSoC Project’s Community Bonding period.
I would like to keep everyone updated about my progress on the project with a weekly report.
I have already set up my development environment and got myself acquainted with sphinx.
I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links here.
The tasks that I have in my mind for this week are:
Becoming familiar with the community practices and processes.
Resolve Existing issues and add small patches/bug fixes.
Deepdive into the existing codebase of the fortranlang webpage.
Discuss with my mentors and other org members regarding implementation of my project plan.
Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: henilp105@gmail.com.
Thanks and Regards,
Henil Shalin Panchal
