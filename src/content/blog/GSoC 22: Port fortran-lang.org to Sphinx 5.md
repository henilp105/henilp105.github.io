Greetings of the Day Everyone,
This week I have Implemented packages and community sections with all the functionalities using Sphinx with jinja templating. So, I thought it would be interesting to get some opinion/review regarding the Community page of the fortran website.
Should we keep the GitHub Activity Stream on the Community page ?
Yes, we should keep the GitHub Activity Stream on community page
No, we should not keep the GitHub Activity Stream on community page
We should add some thing New / Innovative on community page, (please comment below what would you like to have on community page)
I will be maintaining my fork’s github pages here : Fortran website — Fortran Programming Language .
Also, if you have any other suggestions for the Website’s Implementation please feel free to drop them here, I will try my best to incorporate them.
Thank you for participating on this poll!
Thanks and Regards,
