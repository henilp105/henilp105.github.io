Greetings of the Day Everyone!

This week I have Implemented packages and community sections with all the functionalities using the Sphinx with jinja templating.
This week I have also completed porting of all the packages of packages section to Sphinx. All the changes can be found at my fork's github pages.
I will be maintaining my fork’s github pages here : https://henilp105.github.io/fortran-lang.org/ .

I am Happy to Announce that now ALL of the pages of the website are being rendered by Sphinx only.

Please feel free to ping me here or on my mail: henilp105@gmail.com.

I will be regularly posting the weekly blog links here.

Thanks and Regards,
Henil Shalin Panchal
